Design Smells (code smells) -
1. Rigidity (changing one thing, breaks other things)
2. Fragility
3. Immobility
4. Viscosity
5. Needless repetition
6. Opacity (Clarity is important)
7. Needless complexity (if you know something don't just put it in code until it is required by the code)

Remember that duplication of code can be removed with inheritance. 

Keeping methods, variables, and classes violates encapsulation.

Classes should not be huge, it is not performing a specific function that it was designed to perform.

Design should be futuristic but should not be so comprehensive that it becomes complex. Always take next 10 to 15 years in mind.
