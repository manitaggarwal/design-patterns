Creational Design Patterns (5) -

- program should not depend on how objects are created and arranged
- instantiation is an activity that should not always be done in public and can often lead to coupling problems
- new keyword cannot be user on abstract class or an interface, as it is only used to create instances of a concrete class
- encapsulates the knowledge the knowledge about which concrete class that system uses.
- insulate yourself from constant changes to classes that implement these classes.
- point is to exploit polymorphism, so that the actual runtime object is not locked into code
